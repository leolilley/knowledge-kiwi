## Key Concepts

All of these are fully documented in the architecture specification:

- **Reasoning Loops**: Gather → Think → Act → Verify
- **Decision Trees**: Machine-readable, branching logic with cost/success tradeoffs
- **Knowledge Queries**: Standardized, cacheable queries to Knowledge Kiwi
- **Success Criteria**: Quantifiable metrics with thresholds
- **Cost Profiles**: Transparent costs with ROI calculation
- **Parallel Execution**: Explicit semantics for multi-agent coordination
- **State Transfer**: Zero-downtime handoff protocol
- **Pattern Discovery**: Search by reasoning structure for cross-domain transfer
